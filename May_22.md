## Mission Statement

Current Mission: The Lawrence Community Shelter offers safe haven to individuals and families facing homelessness.

Staff have not been satisfied with this mission statement due to use of the words safe haven, because it does not feel compelling, and because families are not a focus (we will get to this later).  A Safe Haven is a type of shelter model that is a 30 day program.  LCS does not meet the definition of a Safe Haven. Also, as much as we would like to, we cannot guarantee safety and should not imply it.  When completing grant applications or describing our agency, we would like a mission statement that not only describes the who, what and why but one that also evokes inspiration.  

LCS held a staff vote on 4 mission statements and the clear winner was:

**Grounded in human rights and social justice, our mission is to advance compassionate solutions for people facing homelessness through advocacy, shelter, and housing.**

It is important for staff to feel invested in the agency's mission and I hope the Board will consider and approve staff input.


## Accounting Policies

When I came to LCS, I realized there were no formal accounting policies in place. It is very important to have these for proper checks and balances, but they are also often required to be submitted with grants to demonstrate good stewardship of grant funds.  I had to draft these accounting policies urgently to include with the Douglas County ARPA funding, but they are simply in draft form.  I would like the Board to begin reviewing them so that we can open discussion for recommended revisions sometime in the near future. I will attach the draft policies and procedures.  

## Douglas County Budget Proposal and ARPA Funds

I submitted the proposal to receive our annual funding from the County 2023 budget.  We met with the County to discuss our proposal.  At that time, we were told that the county funding has been intended to only be used for shelter services and not a housing program. Between the City and the County, the 2019 assessment conducted by Erika Dvorske has been referenced several times. I was asked to revise our budget proposal. With pandemic funding coming to an end, insufficient funding from other sources, and no desire to jeopardize city and county funding, leadership made the difficult decision to propose a staffing model that virtually eliminates all housing by LCS. The final staffing model and services we provide will be dependent on funding.  We can continue a discussion on this as we set goals and begin considering our 2023 budget. A proposal was also submitted to the county for the ARPA funds but funding from this source did not sound promising when we met with the County. I will update when I get further information. I will attach the 2019 assessment for those of you that have not seen it.

## Meetings with Community Partners and City Commissioners

We have been meeting with several community partners to speak about our services and to identify ways we can better collaborate to meet the needs of the people we serve and our community. So far, we have met with Bert Nash, Family Promise, United Way, Douglas County District Attorney Suzanne Valdez, and Minds Matter.  I have been in discussion with Lawrence-Douglas County Housing Authority and we are reopening discussions with Douglas County Reentry.  We have also met with City Commissioners Brad Finkeldei and Lisa Larsen individually.  We are scheduled to speak with Justice Matters and City Commissioner Bart Littlejohn this week and are in the process of scheduling with City Commissioner Courtney Shipley. We have been getting a lot of positive feedback and will continue to have a presence with partnering agencies and other stakeholders to further promote strong relationships.

## Winter Shelter Proposal

Brad Finkeldei contacted me with a proposal that LCS manage the winter shelter this year if the City provides a location and $85,000-100,000 in funding to support it. This proposal is in its very earliest stage. At this time, a location and exact dates have not been identified. We are currently attending a winter shelter focus group that is attempting to identify solutions for this year's winter shelter before the time is upon us.

I do feel that LCS is the most appropriate agency to manage the winter shelter due to the knowledge and experience of the staff/agency and also because we have relationships established with many of the people that will be seeking services. Our biggest barriers in the past have been space and funding. LCS managing the winter shelter would positively impact community perception, demonstrate positive collaboration with the city, and it is 100% within the mission and vision of our agency. I will continue to work with the city and partnering agencies to gather additional information and create a staffing model and financial plan

## Monarch Village

Monarch Village continues to be a topic often brought up by the community, community partners, and the City/County.  We have kept several units unoccupied to have available to isolate those that test positive for Covid.  As we have moved away from high rates of transmission in Douglas County, the questions have become more and more pressing. What we have failed to communicate well is that several units are (and have been) getting used effectively.  In past discussions, the Board has been hesitant to move away from the idea of using these units for families because the program was marketed in that way. In discussions with Dan Rockhill, the architect that made Monarch Village possible, the units were never intended for families when he designed them.  When Studio 804 built these, they specifically had Covid-19 isolation in mind and said that LCS could use them for whatever purpose would be most beneficial after the pandemic came to an end.  Unfortunately, including children and families in appeals for donations generates more money, more quickly.  It is understandable why that decision was made, but we are now feeling the results of that campaign.

Monarch Village units are not appropriate for families. They are only 160 sq. ft.  As a low barrier shelter, we provide services to adults that have the greatest amount of need.  We do not conduct criminal background checks and will soon be ending checks of the sex offender registry.  Because of the demographics we are serving to provide emergency shelter to those with the highest barriers to housing and the greatest need for shelter services, children should not be staying on property. Families are the easiest to house and families often have the least barriers. Low barrier shelter services are meant to give priority to those with the highest acuity. 

Because of this, we have been communicating our current use of Monarch and our vision for Monarch to several of those that have taken interest including funders. We want to continue using Monarch for providing a more private space to those that have significant medical needs, those with SPMI that have demonstrated a congregate setting is not appropriate, as a "soft step" between chronic homelessness and permanent housing, and as Covid isolation.  Our future vision is also to collaborate with Douglas County Reentry to provide a transitional setting for those starting a new journey into society after incarceration and with Lawrence-Douglas County Housing Authority to offer 1 year leases to those receiving a housing voucher but have significant barriers that make it difficult to find housing.  Both of these partnerships are within the mission of LCS and would also generate some revenue.  

While telling various people about our current use of Monarch Village and our future vision, every single person has been very receptive. The overwhelming response is that as long as the units are being put to good use, everyone is happy. We have been harming ourselves more by avoiding the discussion rather than just tackling the truth head on.  Now that we have felt out the waters, so to speak, we are confident in moving in this direction with Monarch Village. If it proves to be a success, it may be easier to secure funding for MV Phase 2 to add 10 additional units.

## Board Materials

I am going to begin revising, updating and sharing items that will continue to help develop our Board, will help us all better understand our roles and responsibilities within the agency, and help everyone feel confident in their knowledge and understanding of our services.  This is perfect timing as we bring on new members to our Board. We are a team and we want our Board to feel like a successful part of the team.


## Gratitude and Final Thoughts

I want to make sure we all take some time to thank Isabel Johnson for the time and commitment she has offered to LCS over the years as a representative of our Board. As announced in December, she made plans to retire when we were able to bring on new members. Isabel will be receiving flowers and a thank you card on Monday from all of us at LCS.

I also want to show appreciation for all of Larissa's hard work with interviewing 3 Board candidates to share with us.

Thank you Christina for coming to visit us this week.  We would love to see everyone individually and get to know our Board members better. I will continue working with each of you to set up times to visit or talk. 

To all of you, we appreciate you and the time you invest in our agency.  You play a vital role to what we do and we depend on you.  Please do not hesitate to tell us what you need from us.
